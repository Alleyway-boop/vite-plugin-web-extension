# Migrate to V3

The only breaking change from v2 &rarr; v3 is Vite 4.

Simply install the latest version of vite and you're good to go.

```sh
pnpm i vite@latest
```

You will likely have to upgrade other Vite plugins you use to versions that also support Vite 4.

> If you're migrating from v1, make sure to follow the [v2 migration](https://v2.vite-plugin-web-extension.aklinker1.io/guide/migration-v2.html) first.
